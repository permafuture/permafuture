  <h3 id="theres-an-old-story-youve-probably-heard-some-version-of-it">There’s an old story. You’ve probably heard some version of it:</h3>

<h2 id="once-for-the-first-time-in-the-history-of-the-world-a-man-bashed-in-his-brothers-head-with-a-rock">Once, for the first time in the history of the world, a man bashed in his brother’s head with a rock.</h2>

<p>From then on, a third area of replicators existed on the planet: technology.</p>

<p>Techniques are a form of meme: knowing how to hit something with a rock is a simple repeatable action. But once memes were sufficiently complex, whole ecosystems of techniques formed around the selection pressure of the natural environment. People with a lot of water do things differently than people in a desert – not everything, but enough to create a selection pressure of cultural values and traditions. Thus societies begin to speciate.</p>

<p>A group of memes that form a collective organism is called a memeplex. A group of memes or memeplexes that are symbiotic with each other create a society. When societies clash, memeplexes evolve in reaction to the new selection pressures. Often they develop exotoxicity: the tendency to destroy other memeplexes for self-preservation.</p>

<h3 id="so-whichever-brother-it-was-that-schismed-the-human-experiment-is-irrelevant-at-some-point-memes-became-weaponized-people-now-allowed-memes-to-select-their-genes-in-this-sense-war-is-a-complicated-form-of-human-husbandry-we-allow-cultural-replicators-to-decide-how-we-mate-and-when-we-die-we-are-no-longer-the-masters-of-memes-this-happened-at-least-10000-years-ago">So whichever brother it was that schismed the human experiment is irrelevant. At some point, memes became weaponized. People now allowed memes to select their genes. In this sense, war is a complicated form of human husbandry. We allow cultural replicators to decide how we mate and when we die. We are no longer the masters of memes. This happened at least 10,000 years ago.</h3>

<p>Once memes gained equality with genes in the selection of humans, we were free to adapt much faster than before. We became cyborgs. A new type of replicator was formed, which I like to call <em>things</em>. It rhymes with <em>genes</em>, and <em>memes</em>. Sort of.</p>

<p>Things are not just objects – rocks and skeletons and such had already existed. And they are not just ideas. They have physical forms, which evolve and need energy to maintain their existence. They are somewhere in-between. Each thing comes with a whole directory of techniques: you can write with a pencil, but you can also use it to measure a bra size or kill a person. Or chew on it. The techniques are implied in the physical form of the thing, not just held in culture. Tables make sense because humans are a certain size and we fold in a certain way. You don’t need to be told how to use a table. But, if you had never seen one before, you might be hard-pressed to imagine it from first principles.</p>

<h2 id="things-have-lives-of-their-own">Things have lives of their own.</h2>

An interesting example is law. The concept of law goes back to Gilgamesh. As long as we have been telling stories about what it means to be human, we have been using them to control and predict future humans.</h3>
