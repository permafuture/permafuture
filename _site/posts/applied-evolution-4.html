  <h2 id="organic-life-is-not-the-limit-of-evolution">Organic life is not the limit of Evolution.</h2>

<p>The Cosmic Trickster fooled around for a few billion years, coding different organisms out of DNA, searching for the next scion of its heroic battle against Entropy. Finally, it came upon a windfall. Some of the thumb-bearing bipedal hairless mammal things invented grunting.</p>

<h3 id="grunting-in-itself-was-not-the-great-leap-but-as-the-grunters-gathered-into-troops-it-created-a-sort-of-grunt-pool-a-fertile-broth-of-actions-and-sounds-that-could-undergo-transference-variation-and-selection-thus-was-born-the-second-replicator-of-earth-memes">Grunting in itself was not the great leap, but as the grunters gathered into troops it created a sort of grunt-pool. A fertile broth of actions and sounds that could undergo transference, variation, and selection. Thus was born the second replicator of Earth: memes.</h3>

<p>Language, culture, a sense of time: all conferred on our species by the power of imitation. Once we were capable of repeating actions and sounds made by others, and capable of imitating them incorrectly whether by accident or on purpose, all we needed was the pressures of biological existence to select which memes (from <em>mimesis</em>, to copy) reproduced and which didn’t.</p>

<p>The process of meme selection happens much faster than the process of genetic selection. Thus were we introduced to  temporal thinking, rare or absent in all other Earthlings. We learned that we could change our behaviors, our words, our thoughts, and become immediately more adapted to our environment – without waiting for the next generation.</p>

<p>Of course Evolution rejoiced in this meme-pool. Replicators that work even faster than DNA? Unheard of, at least on this planet. So it got elbow-deep and started tinkering. It took a while for Entropy to catch up. It was having enough trouble dragging the individual organisms of Earth into death. It could barely keep up with the speed of replication on the DNA level (although the occasional asteroid impact had been pretty effective). This new profusion of replicators was, for a time, unchecked. Then the meme-pool got big enough to support predators and parasites, and Entropy got its chips in the game.</p>

<p>Like any ecology of Earthlings, memes have niches. Some are producers, some are consumers, some are predators, and some are parasites. These last two niches tend to evolve later, as they need simpler forms of life to package energy into hyper-dense formats like meat or sugar. They rely on whole chains or webs of connection between other critters. It took a while for these to evolve in the memetic world, the noosphere or world of ideas. Once they did, they began to wreak havoc on the established niches of the mind – and of the world at large.</p>

<h2 id="some-ideas-through-their-human-proxies-have-extinguished-species-and-destroyed-whole-ecosystems">Some ideas, through their human proxies, have extinguished species and destroyed whole ecosystems.</h2>

<p>That is the danger a higher-speed replicator can pose to a lower-speed. By moving so much faster, it fails to maintain or even see the larger scales of time. This is why humans are so important: we are the shear zone where these two speeds of evolution interact. We have been for thousands of years, since language and culture began.</p>

<p>But an interesting thing happened on the way to the Now. We weren’t just apes with incredible voiceboxes. We also had thumbs. And that made all the difference, at least for the memes.</p>

<p><em>to be continued…</em></p>

One of those, a water-covered ball of iron protected by a shield of asteroids and a jovial bouncer, spun and whirled and sloshed into a sort of broth. This broth created the selection environment in which different elements could conjoin into chemicals.</h3>
