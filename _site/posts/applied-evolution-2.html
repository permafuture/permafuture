  <h2 id="once-nothing-exploded-into-everything">Once, nothing exploded into everything.</h2>

<p>That is the current limit of scientific knowledge about the dawn of time. It’s also the essence of most mystery traditions. We can only speculate about what nothing was doing before it was something.</p>

<p>As this everything exploded, it expanded faster than it expanded. (That’s not exactly true, but the particulars of cosmic inflation are a complicated story for another time.)</p>

<p>Let us say, empty space expanded faster than information. This is why we can only see 13.6 billion light-years in any direction. Not because we are at the center of the universe, but because information takes time to cross space. And we’ve only had 13.6 billion years for it to get here. This state of affairs was, of course, initiated by Entropy.</p>

<p>So each zone of space seethes with the same uniform hydrogen fog. But in the expanding process, a texture forms in spacetime. Like stretch marks in skin, or the cracked surface of a carrot cake. Irregularities appear as some parts of spacetime stretch faster than others. Entropy doesn’t mind this texturing. In a sense, the more complicated and nonsensical the universe is, the more Entropy wins. The few fundamental forces of the universe (gravity, electromagnetism, strong and weak nuclear) are so diffuse that they take incredible amounts of time to accrete.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Entropy, incredible amounts of time were all we had. That accretion, combined with the variations in space texture, gave birth to Evolution. We (evolving beings) could innovate new combinations of atoms at different levels of gravity, heat and light. And we could propagate the successful ones forward in time.</p>

<p>This was how mass formed, how galaxies began to swirl around supermassive black holes, how dense regions of hydrogen compacted so heavily they began to undergo fusion. How heavy elements 
formed, how they balled up into planets both solid and gaseous. Universes evolved, selecting for ones where irregularities allowed for complex elements. Planets selected for coherent orbits – if they didn’t, they were bound to smash into each other or tear each other apart. Suns selected for a Goldilocks zone between superdense implosion and cool diffusion.</p>

But from the clues we have found at the scene of the crime, this is a pretty good reconstruction of the way Evolution broke into the house of Entropy.</h3>

One of those, a water-covered ball of iron protected by a shield of asteroids and a jovial bouncer, spun and whirled and sloshed into a sort of broth. This broth created the selection environment in which different elements could conjoin into chemicals.</h3>
