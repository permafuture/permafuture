      <h2>I'm Max. I build the future.</h2>
    <p>I write, design and build at the intersection of long-term thinking and catastrophic change.</p>
    <p>I'm a certified permaculture designer, a member of the Long Now Foundation, and an Associate of the Institute of Atemporal Studies.</p>
    <p>When the 21st century really kicks in, I will be with the book people, protecting the books.</p>
