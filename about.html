      <h2>I'm Max Brewer. I design for the future.</h2>
      <p>Permaculture designer. Community organizer. Foresight strategist.</p> 
      <p>I specialize in sustainable infrastructure and community resilience. I know what to do when the power goes out. When the gas stations close. When you can't trust your government.</p>
      <p> I see disasters before they hit, and make them hurt less.</p>
