## Evolution. We're in it. We're of it. We can't escape it, and it defines more about our reality than we usually admit.

I'm here to tell you a story. It's the story of how we got to be where we are. More importantly, it's the only story that's going to help us predict where we're headed. Other narratives claim to do so, but when we look deeper we see that they benefit only those Corporate Death Cultists who have the money and influence to propagate them. 

This story -- the story of Applied Evolution -- fits with the actual behaviors of life, of people and of ideas. When we apply *cui bono* to  Evolution, we see that the beneficiaries of this narrative include all the beings on this planet. Thus we don't need a vast network of subsidiaries to reproduce our story. It is always being produced by our entire environment. Welcome to the world you live in.

### Evolution? Isn't that old history? 

Aren't we done with the process of evolving, now that we have culture? Well, no. That's the short answer. And the long answer doesn't have to rely on passe notions of human potential and personal evolution via New Age channelers. Evolution is not only happening without us, it is happening within us. We are all products of evolution, from the planetary level to the subcellular. 

Evolution is the invisible hand of the universe. It's the mechanism that God flipped the switch on thirteen billion years ago. Or it's an impersonal and incidental set of circumstances that only seem to exist  in our universe due to the anthropic principle. Who cares. It's not as important why it's happening, or if it is inevitable or a fluke. What's important for our purposes -- practical, Applied purposes -- is that it has been happening, it is happening, it will be happening. 

Let me give you a little context on your place in the universe. Remember, things happen all the time but they happen on different scales. So the pattern we'll see is self-similar. It repeats at different scales within its own structure. In fact that's one of the reasons it's so effective. We'll take the story of our Universe, the story of Sol system, the story of Earthlings, and the stories of humanity, language, and technology as a nested story in which the protagonist is this negentropic principle called Evolution. But first, we'll need a little bit of character background.

### Who is this enigmatic hero? What secrets and mysteries hide underneath the mask of evolution? What challenges does it face and what advantages does it have toward overcoming them?

Evolution is the emergent interaction of replicators. Replicators are any piece of information that behaves in a certain way: namely, replicating. It's a generic term for a wide variety of mathematical attractors, but the most obvious one in current evolutionary theory is the gene. The gene is a single piece of deoxyribonucleic acid, a letter in the language of life. Many genes, hundreds to millions, compose any single organism. Each gene is competing against the rest of the candidate genes whenever sexual recombination happens. 

## Two organisms mating and producing an offspring is like remixing two songs together. Jay-Z's Black Album and the Beatles' White Album created Dangermouse's Grey Album. Remixing and repeating in systems like this is the game of evolution. 

There's a simple scientific definition of replicators: transference + variability + selection. Any piece of information which can be copied, changed, and compared will be subject to evolution. Replicators come in all shapes or sizes. They're the substrate through which the evolutionary current flows. The main thing about replicators is that they strive to replicate and adapt in a situation that is partly, but not entirely, of their own making. The situation itself is the selector. The environment keeps setting new parameters.

So this environment, the setting for our story, is also the villian. A classic man vs. nature plot, as drama theorists would have it. Except that man vs. nature is only one of the fractal conflicts played out here. On the grand and cosmic scale, Evolution is pitted against its sibling/spouse/nemesis, Entropy. 

Entropy may be the older brother here. Obviously it gets harder to tell, the futher we go in the macro dimension. Certainly most of the observable universe is following the Arrow of Time, the Dark One, the Cold Fuzz. All the planets, stars and galaxies we see are circling the drain. In some billions of years, if Entropy gets its way, the entire universe will be a uniform pudding of used-up hydrogen atoms. 

### Fortunately, we have a champion. So let us begin our legend where legends begin: at the dawn of time.
