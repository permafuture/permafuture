### So it was that a little yellow star on the edge of a spiral galaxy birthed a handful of gas giants and rocky dwarf planets. One of those, a water-covered ball of iron protected by a shield of asteroids and a jovial bouncer, spun and whirled and sloshed into a sort of broth. This broth created the selection environment in which different elements could conjoin into chemicals. 

My favorite theory for how this happened: clay deposits in riverbeds, which are a sort of replicator themselves. The particular composition of any given silica clay defines whether other clays will stick to it and join its composition. The more successful replicators also transfer their composition downstream, sending out envoys to colonize similar niches in the river. Clay deposits are layered on a molecular scale, like 3d printing at the smallest chemical level. As the silicon substrate builds up, layer by layer, other elements are trapped within it. These are stacked together so close that they form composite molecules. Of these uncountable molecules, one finds the adaptation that allows it to copy itself. This goes on to form the essence of all nucleic acids, the replicators of 'life' as we know it: RNA and DNA.

So now we have three levels of replicators: universes, heavenly bodies, and life. There may be life on other planets. Planets may be alive, even, in some way we don't understand. But as far as we can tell, Earth is unique. The atmosphere itself exhibits a key feature of life: negentropic homeostasis. Earth is consistently more temperate and has more reactive gases in the atmosphere than the laws of the universe otherwise allow. 

## We are an exception. And we have been, for over 4 billion years.

This is the Gaia hypothesis: *life on the planet has been creating and maintaining the conditions for life on the planet*. There is no other planet we've seen in all the universe that maintains this much oxygen in its atmosphere. According to Entropy, the entire planet should be 
rust or fire any second now. 

But the simple cyanobacteria in the ocean, some of the earliest Earthlings, constantly balance the atmosphere through negative and positive feedback loops. When these creatures evolved from the basic nucleic acids, they caused the first great pollution crisis on on the planet. They filled the atmosphere with oxygen -- causing the first great mass extinction. All Earthlings had to adapt to this situation, and they did. Anaerobic bacteria learned to hide in the guts of air-breathing creatures, which produced carbon dioxide to replenish the fuels needed by the oxygen-producers. A huge weird bootstrapping of life exploded onto the scene. Mitochondria merged with their host cells and created another form of energy. The whole process of Earthling evolution has been an interplay of adaptations, competition, and symbiosis. 

This organic chemical replicator called DNA (and RNA and mDNA etc) had an advantage over the other replicators like planets and suns. It works on a faster. By many orders of magnitude. Though Evolution never lost its interest in the other places in the Universe, it did have much more opportunity to play around on Earth. 

And play around it did. In four billion years it did R&D on countless variations of life. We can think of some of the weirder ones today: trilobytes, barnacles, long-necked dinosaurs with noses on their foreheads. But most of the trials left no evidence, or happened at scales we're only beginning to explore. 

Earth is the outer limit of Applied Evolution, at least for now. We're not yet to the point where we can apply planet-scale or solar-scale evolution. We may get there soon -- we do have quite a few planets and rocky moons to fool around with -- but not if we don't get our house in order first. We need to apply evolution at the scales of Gaia and smaller. That's where we can use this knowledge for the practical purpose of surviving the Sixth Mass Extinction. After we're past the bottleneck, then we'll worry about sporing other planets. 

### After all, we may not be a successful species. It's too early to tell.
