### Chaos makes the world. This has been known to people throughout time. Tiamat, Shiva, Eris, Coyote. The Trickster giveth and the Trickster sure fucking taketh away. So be it. 

What is the meaning of chaos? Chaos is the undiluted raw static of the world, the terrible blistering changingness that permeates every sensation and gives rise to every conflict. Chaos is the force of entropy. It draws us all toward the cold pudding of heat death, the uniform sludge of all information at once indistinguished. And yet it also gives life, and form, and change: without that entropy, life would not evolve. Without death and mutation there would be naught on this planet except a vast prokaryote soup. So chaos also stirs our greatest feelings of fear, because it is change. It threatens the self. It whispers that beyond my mouth and my ears, beyond my cell walls, beyond the walls of my cell, the universe cares nothing.

But chaos does not play games. Humans play games. Games are the greatest human invention, the pursuit of meaning in a chthulic niverse. Games are the co-creation of beauty and form for no reason other than the absurd thrownness of our condition. All human activity takes the form of games, at least in the realm of inter-action.  Chaos allows us to play our little human games, and we get away with a lot of meaning-creation. We can't defy the waterfall of time, but we can play in it.

### So human reality is not chaos. Chaos is the blind spinning mouth at the center of our galaxy. Chaos is the infuriated fusion in our local star. Chaos is the whirling storms of dead Venus. 

Earth, that blue gem, that insane teeming jungle, is still breathing. Gaia still self-regulates her temperature three billion years into her fruiting. The biosphere and the humans who emerge from it are an oasis of life in the universe. Lichen growing on the gears of a machine.

So life is not chaos. Life is making meaning. Life is writing stories with carbon. Humans, and all our games, are subplots in a larger story of life vs. chaos. The stories we tell to make meaning out of our lives, make the meaning of our lives. 

The work of the wizard is to tell the story of life vs chaos, to warp reality in favor of the self-organizing principle. To gather bubbles of chaos and compress them into gems of meaning. And to pass those stories on. To give them a life of their own. To let them grow, instead of dissolve back into quantum froth.

### This is the work of the wizard.
