### Cultural artifacts are also things. An interesting example is law. The concept of law goes back to Gilgamesh. As long as we have been telling stories about what it means to be human, we have been using them to control and predict future humans. 

Law is a form of code. If you don't believe me, get a book on programming and the Vehicle Code of your state and look at them side by side. Law is a way of structuring human behavior. It is a coding language of memes: if (situation), then (human behavior). But it is only a thing inasmuch as it affects the material reality: with the development of writing. Writing is when we as humans really mastered memetic programming. As we will see, not all the things that we did with it were successful. Especially by the metrics of DNA-based life.

Fast-forward a few thousand years. Watch empires rise and fall. 

Empires are a thing. A huge one, with many moving parts, and a visibile self-organizing effect on material reality. They have lives of their own. And they die. During the death of the Feudalist memeplex in Europe, some clever memetic engineers decided to build some things that wouldn't die so easily. They invented what we now call the Corporation. 

## The Corporation is an entity that lives for its own gain, extracts energy from any possible memeplex it can tap, and has no concern for human well-being outside of its own self-interest. If someone genetically engineered such a beast today, it would be called a monster. And rightly so.

Now, parasitic memes have been around for a long time. A lot of religions survive this way, by absorbing the host's energy or even virally replicating through humans. Much has been said on the subject of viral ideas, but here we are more concerned with whole ecologies. 

The main parasite on human activity is the meme of debt. Debt is a promise to exchange future energy for current energy at a greater-than 1-to-1 ratio. The memetic parasite of debt and credit feeds the human need for instant gratification while disguising the true cost of its patronage. It builds and builds without regard for the finite resources of our solar system. Who will rake in all the cash on the final pot, when the Sun cools and expands and eats our planet like a pork rind? Maybe we'll be on Mars or even Pluto by that point. But the point remains: *whoever is holding the bag at the end of the game is going to be mighty disappointed with the used-up rocks we have left.*

In the Corporation, Debt finally found a host body that didn't need to cooperate with the needs of puny humans. Between the two, the planet is straddled by much greater beasts than any dinosaur. The irresponsible memeplexes plunder the Earth's resources and transform them into something called "The Economy.  And we find ourselves in a great Crisis the likes of which humanity has never seen. Our global climate is heaving, the long-stored carbon deposits are sizzling into the atmosphere at alarming rates, and more people than ever before rely on ever-more fragile and unrealistic life support chains. 

### Entropy is waiting in the wings, rubbing its hands and cackling with glee.

And now we've created a new class of thing, networked digital computers. These are replicating memes by themselves, faster than we've ever imagined. It's the way the internet works: all information you see on a screen had to be copied, with great fidelity, from every other place it's stored on the internet. It also contains variability, with signal distortion and even cosmic rays creating mutations in the data. (Not to mention remix tech.) So the exponential explosion of information on the internet is an extension of the previous evolutionary floods. From chemistry to biology to culture to things, replicators keep evolving. And they keep evolving faster.

So there you have it. A myth for our time. Evolution and Entropy are the expressed principles of the universe. The Light and Dark, the Yang and Yin, the Implicit and Explicit. Through their polarity they give birth to the trinity of Variability, Selection and Transference. From the outer cosmos to the inner spaces of mind, Evolution self-organizes and Entropy unwinds.

## Evolution birthed us. Entropy would eat us. Time to take a side.

*end.*
